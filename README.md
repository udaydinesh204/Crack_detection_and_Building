# Crack_detection_and_Building
This is AI capstone project with deep learning on the dataset Crack detection and buildings. Dataset   
Crack detection has vital importance for structural health monitoring and inspection. We would like to train a network to detect Cracks, we will denote the images that contain cracks as positive and images with no cracks as negative. In this lab you are going to have to download the data and study the dataset. There are two questions in this lab, including listing the path to some of the image files as well as plotting a few images. Remember the results as you will be quizzed on them.

Download Data
For your convenience, I have placed the data on a server which you can retrieve easily using the wget command. So let's run the following line of code to get the data. Given the large size of the image dataset, it might take some time depending on your internet speed.

And now if you check the left directory pane, you should see the zipped file concrete_crack_images_for_classification.zip appear. So, let's go ahead and unzip the file to access the images. Given the large number of images in the dataset, this might take a couple of minutes, so please be patient, and wait until the code finishes running.

Now, you should see two folders appear in the left pane: Positive and Negative. Negative is the negative class like we defined it earlier and it represents the concrete images with no cracks. Positive on the other hand is the positive class and represents the concrete images with cracks.

Important Note: There are thousands and thousands of images in each folder, so please don't attempt to double click on the folders. This may consume all of your memory and you may end up with a 50*** error. So please **DO NOT DO IT.
